# Data-Visualization


A project built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript focused on sorting techniques can be a great way to demonstrate the inner workings of popular algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. This project can showcase how each sorting technique works, its time complexity, and how it can be implemented in code. The project can include a user interface that allows users to input an unsorted list of items and choose which sorting algorithm they want to use. The user interface can also display the sorted list of items after the sorting process is complete. With this project, developers can improve their understanding of sorting algorithms while also enhancing their skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
